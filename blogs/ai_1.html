        <h1>Artificial Intelligence #1</h1>
        <p>Creating AI means creating intelligent machines 
            and intelligent software. Intelligent means they
             act as we do in the real world. This will connect us deeply
             with our machines, like we are connected and attached
             to other humans. An AI that can talk to me like a friend,
             an AI with whom i can discuss anything with.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various techniques used to create various types 
            of AI. Some of them are:
            <ul>
                <li>Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Deep Learning</li>
                <li>other stuffs that i don't know now.</li>
            </ul><br>
            But problem is that these techniques are not easily achievable 
            to everybody, you have to study and practise a lot and then you
            will be able to make something. And then also you will need large costly hardware, 
            to create your own Ai. Means today if i want to create an AI that can talk 
            with me, that can be my friend in every way, like Jarvis, it is not possible.
            With emro i will make this possible, it will have all tools that i need to make my own 
            AI friend. Everything that is useful, in a form that is easily useable by anyone.
            You have a mind,  and you will be able to create your own AI friend's mind.
            This is going to be my only project in the field of AI. Using emro platform,
            anyone can create a real AI. A real Artificial Intelligence friend.
            Are you getting it? A real AI friend, that you have created for yourself.
            Think how many different type of friends you can create.
            Creating emro is going to take long. So i will need to wait to create my own AI,
            until I don't create emro, the tool for AI creation.
