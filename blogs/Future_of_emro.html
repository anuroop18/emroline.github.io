      <h2 id="what-is-emro-">What is emro?</h2>
      <p>Emro is a tool for creating AI.</p>
      <h2 id="what-will-emro-become-">What will emro become?</h2>
      <p>I will make emro the best toolset for AI creation. It will have everything that is required to create an AI. ANd best part is that, every tool will be easy and accessible without having to study about AI. I will be able to create as many Artificial Intelligence tools as much I desire. I am creating emro for myself. Not for anyone else. So it will have everything that I need. And believe me, I am very creative and explorive in nature, whatever anyone will need will already be available. And I don&#39;t love at all to code each and every thing, so I will create it to be very easy to use for me. And as a result it will be easy to use for anyone. And I know what it feels like, when you see whole world creating something, you also want to create, you have bigger ideas, but you have neither required skills nor the resources needed. I am feeling the same right now, while I am watchiing everyone else creating something using AI. That is why I am creating this, so that I can create AI without really knowing what is going on inside. Because I want to create, and if it works as I need, I don&#39;t care how it is working from inside. I will just use it happily. That is what a creator feels while watching his/her creation i amazement.</p>
